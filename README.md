# Tic-Tac-Toe

This repository contains the code for my first major project completed using Ruby. This project will put to the test everything I have learned so far, and also serves as my first project that implements Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

I have gone through various exercises to learn OOP principles, but this project will be the first time I apply them in a practical setting. This project is not just about building a functional application, but also about learning and experiencing the benefits of OOP.

The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with OOP and Ruby, and to see the impact that OOP principles can have on the coding process. I am excited to dive into this project and to see what I can achieve with my newfound knowledge.

If you would like to follow along, or simply take a look at the code, feel free to clone this repository and explore it on your local machine.
