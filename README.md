# Tic-Tac-Toe

This will be my first major project completed using Ruby. It will test everything I have learnt so far,
and will also be my first project that makes use of OOP principles. While I have gone over many of the
OOP principles in various different exercises, this will be my first time using it in a project, and I 
expect it to be a learning experience.
